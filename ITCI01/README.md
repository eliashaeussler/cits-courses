# Information technology for Cyber & IT security (ITCI01)

📆 Winter 2024/25 &middot; 🧠 2 seminar papers + 2 exercises &middot; ✅ Finished

This course teaches the basics of computer architectures and distributed systems.
Another essential part of the module was an in-depth look at the Internet of Things
(IoT). Last but not least, various transmission techniques and mechanisms in networks
were also taught.

We were required to complete an exercise and a piece of coursework on two different
topics. In the first topic, IoT, I developed a smart home monitoring system with
Arduino using various specifications and with the help of [Tinkercad]. For the
seminar paper, I decided to investigate individual IoT protocols with regard to
interoperability and the associated challenges in smart home systems.

In the second subject area, "Networks", I developed a network diagram as an exercise
using [GNS3] and on the basis of given requirements. I dedicated my seminar paper to
the topic of "Secure name resolutions: The role of DNS over TLS (DoT), DNS over HTTPS
(DoH) & DNSSEC". I took a brief look at the advantages of the individual technologies
and analyzed the extent to which they are suitable for secure name resolutions.
