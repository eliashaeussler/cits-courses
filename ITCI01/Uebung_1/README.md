# Exercise #1: Smart home system

## Task

The task was to develop a comprehensive smart home system that integrates
various sensors and actuators. The system was to detect movement, trigger
an alarm if necessary, control the lighting and implement additional
functions such as door control, temperature control and IoT integration.

## Implementation

I have implemented the task in [Tinkercad]. The control unit is an Arduino
and a plug-in board that connects the individual components.

I submitted the following files:

* [Arduino sourcecode](Code.ino) (INO)
* [Component list](Komponenten.csv) (CSV) ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª
* [Circuit diagram](Schaltplan.pdf) (PDF)
* [Screenshot](Screenshot.png) (PNG)
