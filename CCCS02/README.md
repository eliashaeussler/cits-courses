# Cloud Computing & Cloud Security (CCCS02)

📆 Winter 2024/25 &middot; 🧠 4 exercises &middot; ✅ Finished

In this course, we learned about various areas of cloud computing. We learned what "cloud" actually means,
what service models are available (IaaS, SaaS, etc.), and how to effectively secure cloud environments.

To successfully complete the course, we had to complete four tasks. These involved examining various scenarios
from the field of cloud security and classifying and evaluating incidents, some of which were realistic.

I submitted the following assignments:
