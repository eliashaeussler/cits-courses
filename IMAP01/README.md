# Cyber & IT security: Implementation & application (IMAP01)

📆 Summer 2024 &middot; 🧠 Seminar paper &middot; ✅ Finished

In this course, possibilities for the application of security measures
in different corporate contexts were demonstrated. Implementation
approaches were also identified to facilitate the integration of
security.

In my seminar paper, I dealt specifically with the integration
of security measures in CI/CD pipelines. This is a practical
application of DevSecOps, which I described both theoretically
and demonstrated using a practical example. The paper is
entitled "DevSecOps in practice: Security as an integral part
of Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery":
