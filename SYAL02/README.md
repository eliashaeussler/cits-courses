# System Analysis (SYAL02)

📆 Winter 2024/25 &middot; 🧠 Seminar paper &middot; ✅ Finished

In this course, we looked at various methods of system analysis, including
penetration testing, risk analysis, threat modeling, forensic analysis and
intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS). We also gained insights
into requirements management, learned about functional and performance
analysis and explored systems engineering and aspect-oriented modeling.

I dedicated my seminar paper to incident response (IR). I highlighted the
different phases of IR and demonstrated its practical applicability using
two case studies. I also identified challenges and best practices in the
field of IR and business continuity management (BCM). I published the work
under the title "Incident Response and Emergency Management: Analyzing
Effective Strategies for Responding to Cyber Attacks":
