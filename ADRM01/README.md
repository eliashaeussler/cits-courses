# Advanced Research Methods (ADRM01)

📆 Winter 2024/25 &middot; 🧠 Seminar paper + 4 exercises &middot; ✅ Finished

In preparation for the upcoming research work in the focus module of my studies, we dealt with the various
scientific methods of quantitative and qualitative research in this course. The task was to complete four
exercises and then write a seminar paper. The seminar paper was to focus on the development of a
questionnaire that would be used to examine the determinants of social identity, communication quality, and
job satisfaction in virtual groups based on four given hypotheses. Two of the four tasks were written
assignments in the area of hypothesis formation and scale development.

I submitted the following assignments:

* 📝 [Seminar paper](Studienarbeit.pdf) (PDF) 🇩🇪
* 📝 [Exercise #2](Aufgabe_2.pdf) (PDF) 🇩🇪
* 📝 [Exercise #3](Aufgabe_3.pdf) (PDF) 🇩🇪
