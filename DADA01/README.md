# Data modeling and database systems (DADA01)

📆 Summer 2024 &middot; 🧠 Seminar paper &middot; ✅ Finished

This course focused on various topics in the area of data modeling and database systems.
Relational and NoSQL databases were explained and an introduction to SQL was given. In
addition, ERM and UML for data modeling were introduced and initial insights into the
security of database systems were provided.

Following on from the last topic, I wrote my seminar paper “Data protection in relational
database systems: Technical and organizational measures for implementing the GDPR”, where
I presented techniques for ensuring data protection in relational database systems. The
focus was very much on the implementation of technical and organizational measures required
by the GDPR for data protection-compliant processing of personal data in database systems:
