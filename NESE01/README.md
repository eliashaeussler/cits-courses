# Network Security (NESE01)

📆 Winter 2024/25 &middot; 🧠 Seminar paper &middot; ✅ Finished

Various application areas of network security were taught in
this course. In addition to a general introduction to network
security, this included topics such as encryption and authentication,
the various types of attack in communication systems, cloud
security and virtualization, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI),
Transport Layer Security (TLS), Firewall systems and an overview
of Virtual Private Networks (VPN).

I dedicated the submission in the form of a seminar paper to the
topic of "Forensic analysis of network attacks: Identification
of typical attack patterns with Wireshark". I highlighted the
various use cases of network forensics and showed how the
Wireshark tool can contribute to a forensic analysis and how it
can help to identify typical attack patterns such as Spoofing,
Sniffing and DDoS attacks:
