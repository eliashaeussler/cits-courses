# Neural networks & Deep Learning (NNDL91)

📆 Summer 2024 &middot; 🧠 Programming task & written report &middot; ✅ Finished

In this course, the entire life cycle for the development of an ML ("machine learning")
model was taught. The task was to develop and train your own ML model. This was to be
done in the context of image classification using a freely chosen topic.

I decided to develop an ML model for classifying healthy and diseased banana plants. I
implemented the programmatic part of the project with [Python][1] and [TensorFlow][2],
bundled in a [Jupyter notebook][3]. In addition, I wrote a short written project report
describing the entire life cycle from conception, data preparation and modeling to the
final training of the ML model.

I submitted the following documents for review:

* 🏗️ [Programming task](BananaHealthClassification.ipynb) (Jupyter Notebook)
* 📝 [Written report](Projektbericht.pdf) (PDF) 🇩🇪

_This course is not actually part of my "Cyber & IT security" studies, but comes from the
["Data Science & Management"][4] degree program. I deliberately chose the course as an elective._
